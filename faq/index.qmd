### What is forplotR?

`forplotR` is an R package that helps organize, check, analyze, and report **forest plot inventory data**, with a special focus on data produced within the ForestPlots.net workflow (field sheets and query sheets). It encourages reproducibility and streamlines the path from raw data to curation.


### What can I use forplotR for?

- **Convert ForestPlots spreadsheets for herbarium workflows** with `fp_herb_converter()`: turns ForestPlots-format sheets into herbarium-friendly formats to support curation and digitization steps.
- **Organize voucher images** with `mk_voucher_dirs()`: scaffolds a standardized folder structure for voucher photos (under your chosen `voucher_imgs` root), ensuring consistent paths that downstream functions (e.g., `plot_for_balance()` and `plot_html_map()`) can reference reliably.
- **Build complete plot reports (PDF)** with `plot_for_balance()`: includes metadata, specimen maps, per-subplot maps, species checklists with anchors to tags, and export of collection sheets. Optionally, compute and show **above-ground biomass (AGB)** using the `BiomasaFP` package in a dedicated section.
- **Create interactive HTML maps** with `plot_html_map()`: generates a Leaflet map and saves the HTML **directly in your project directory** (side by side with `voucher_imgs`), honoring your filters and layout tweaks.

### What inputs does forplotR expect?

- ForestPlots-format spreadsheets such as **`fp_query_sheet`** or **`field_sheet`** (XLSX).
- Optional CSVs to compute **AGB** in `plot_for_balance()`.
- Typical project folders may include an image directory (e.g., `voucher_imgs`) used by the reporting and mapping functions.


### What output can forplotR generate?

- **PDF reports** (from `plot_for_balance()`).
- **Voucher image directories** (from `mk_voucher_dirs()`): automatically scaffolds folders under `voucher_imgs` based on the **preliminary taxonomic ID** in your spreadsheet, ensuring predictable paths for images referenced in reports and maps.
- **Interactive HTML maps** (from `plot_html_map()`, saved at the project root).
- **CSV/XLSX exports** produced during conversion and quality-control steps.

### How do I install forplotR?

Visit the [Get Started guide](/get-started/index.qmd) for step-by-step installation from GitHub (e.g., via `devtools::install_github("DBOSlab/forplotR")`).


### Is forplotR free to use?

Yes. `forplotR` is open source, licensed under the [MIT License](https://opensource.org/license/mit/).


### Does forplotR modify my original files?

By default, functions **read your inputs and write separate outputs** (reports, maps, converted sheets). Your source files remain unchanged unless you explicitly overwrite them in your own workflow.


### Who are the developers of forplotR?

- Giulia Ottino ([\@DBOSlab](https://github.com/DBOSlab))
- Domingos Cardoso ([\@DBOSlab](https://github.com/DBOSlab))

### Where can I report bugs or request features?

Submit issues on GitHub: [forplotR Issues](https://github.com/DBOSlab/forplotR/issues).


### Where can I ask questions and discuss forplotR?

Join our community via [GitHub Discussions](https://github.com/DBOSlab/forplotR/discussions) to ask questions, suggest ideas, or help others.


### How does forplotR relate to ForestPlots.net?

`forplotR` works **with** the ForestPlots.net inventory workflow by processing its data products (e.g., field/query sheets). It **does not replace** ForestPlots.net; instead, it provides a programmatic, reproducible toolkit for QA/QC, analysis, and reporting based on those datasets.
