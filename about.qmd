## Overview

`forplotR` is an R package designed to integrate and streamline the processing of data from long-term forest monitoring plots. By linking the physical voucher (specimen) to its associated spatial, taxonomic, and metadata information, it supports the concept of the extended specimen. The package responds to the growing need to systematize complex datasets in ways that not only ensure scientific rigor and reproducibility, but also simplify fieldwork logistics and post-field data processing — a major challenge in large-scale biodiversity monitoring.

The package interacts with the [ForestPlots.net standard plot inventory protocol](https://forestplots.net/) by reading standardized field templates and converting specimen records into herbarium-ready outputs, including the JABOT format, BRAHMS format, or any other user-defined structure.

It also provides tools for organizing voucher image directories based on preliminary taxonomic identification and individual voucher codes. These directories are dynamically updated to reflect changes in taxonomic determination, maintaining a coherent and traceable folder structure.

In addition, `forplotR` generates comprehensive PDF reports with overview maps of the plot, maps filtered by collection status (e.g., collected vs. uncollected), and subplot-specific maps. Optionally, it also produces an `.xlsx` spreadsheet summarizing the percentage of collected individuals per subplot.

The package includes functionality for producing interactive HTML maps for specimen visualization, with filtering options based on taxonomic groups, collection status, or the presence of voucher images.

## The ForestPlots.net

ForestPlots.net is a global collaborative network that standardizes and integrates forest monitoring efforts across the tropical regions. It provides tools and protocols for establishing long-term permanent plots, where researchers can collect consistent data on tree species, diameters, locations, and dynamics over time.The platform enables scientists to monitor forest composition, structure, and changes in carbon stocks, biodiversity, and ecosystem processes. By adhering to a shared methodology, ForestPlots.net allows for comparisons across different regions and time periods, supporting large-scale analyses of forest ecology and climate change impacts.
